#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! This crate provides the `ProcessOwned` type, a value
//! that shares its lifetime with the process *unless* it
//! can be optimally freed earlier than that.
//! 
//! Internally, `ProcessOwned` uses the `Rc` type to
//! ensure that the value is only dropped when the last
//! owner is dropped. The specific implementation is
//! subject to change for performance reasons.

/// A value that is owned by the process itself.
/// 
/// The lifetime of a value is tied to its owner. When the
/// owner is dropped, the value is dropped as well. This
/// object uses the `Rc` type internally to ensure that
/// the value is only dropped when the last owner is dropped.
/// The specific implementation is subject to change for
/// performance reasons.
/// 
/// When a `ProcessOwned` is initialized as a global static
/// variable with the `lazy_static` crate, it will never be
/// dropped. This allows values to easily and clearly share
/// the scope of the entire process.
